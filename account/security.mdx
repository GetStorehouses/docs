## Overview

Storehouses is built with security and privacy as core principles. Your portfolio contains sensitive information about valuable assets, and we take protecting that data seriously. This guide covers security best practices, privacy features, and how to keep your account secure.

<Card title="Privacy First" icon="shield-halved">
  Storehouses is designed from the ground up to protect your privacy. We don't require identity verification, don't collect phone numbers, and never sell your data.
</Card>

## Account Security Best Practices

### Strong Passwords

Your password is the first line of defense for your account.

<Card title="Password Requirements" icon="key">
  Storehouses requires passwords that meet these minimum standards:
  - At least 8 characters
  - One uppercase letter
  - One lowercase letter
  - One number
  - Special characters recommended
</Card>

**Best practices for passwords:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Use Unique Passwords" icon="fingerprint">
    Never reuse passwords across different services. If one service is compromised, unique passwords protect your other accounts.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Password Manager" icon="vault">
    Use a password manager like 1Password, Bitwarden, or LastPass to generate and store complex passwords securely.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Long & Complex" icon="shuffle">
    Longer passwords are exponentially more secure. Consider passphrases: 4-5 random words (e.g., "correct-horse-battery-staple").
  </Card>

  <Card title="Change Regularly" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Change your password periodically, especially if you suspect compromise or after using public computers.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Recommended Password Managers

<Tip>
  Popular password managers that work great with Storehouses:
  - **1Password** - Cross-platform with family sharing
  - **Bitwarden** - Open-source and free tier available

  - **Dashlane** - Includes VPN and dark web monitoring
  - **Apple Keychain** - Built-in for Apple users

## Data Encryption

### Client-Side Encryption (Beta)

<Card title="Pro & Lifetime Feature" icon="lock">
  Storehouses is developing client-side encryption for Pro and Lifetime users, adding an extra layer of security where your data is encrypted on your device before being sent to servers.
</Card>

**How client-side encryption works:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data Encrypted on Device">
    Your portfolio data is encrypted on your device using your encryption key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Encrypted Data Sent to Server">
    Only encrypted data is transmitted and stored on Storehouses servers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decrypted on Access">
    Data is decrypted on your device when you access it
  </Step>
  <Step title="Zero-Knowledge">
    Storehouses servers never have access to your unencrypted data
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Client-side encryption is currently in beta testing for Pro and Lifetime users. General availability coming soon.
</Note>

### Transport Encryption

All data transmitted between your device and Storehouses is encrypted:

<Card title="TLS/SSL Encryption" icon="shield-check">
  - All connections use HTTPS with TLS 1.3
  - 256-bit encryption for data in transit
  - Modern cipher suites for maximum security
  - Certificate pinning for mobile apps
</Card>

### Database Encryption

Your portfolio data is encrypted at rest:

<ParamField path="Encryption Standard" type="string">
  AES-256 encryption for all stored data
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Key Management" type="string">
  Encryption keys managed by secure key management systems
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="Backup Encryption" type="string">
  All database backups are also encrypted
</ParamField>

## Privacy & Data Collection

### What Storehouses Collects

<Card title="Minimal Data Collection" icon="database">
  Storehouses only collects data necessary for service functionality:
  - **Email address** - For authentication and account recovery
  - **Password hash** - Securely hashed, never stored in plain text
  - **Portfolio data** - Items, collections, locations you create
  - **Usage analytics** - Anonymous feature usage for product improvement
  - **Billing information** - Processed and stored by Stripe, not Storehouses
</Card>

### What Storehouses Doesn't Collect

<Card title="Privacy by Design" icon="shield-halved">
  Storehouses intentionally does NOT collect:
  - **Phone numbers** - Not required for any feature
  - **Identity verification** - No KYC or ID documents
  - **Social security numbers** - Never requested
  - **Physical addresses** - Optional for location tracking only
  - **Browsing history** - No tracking across other websites
  - **Third-party cookies** - No advertising or tracking cookies
</Card>

<Tip>
  Your privacy is paramount. Storehouses doesn't sell your data, share it with advertisers, or use it for any purpose other than providing the service you signed up for.
</Tip>

### No Identity Verification Required

Unlike financial platforms, Storehouses:
- Doesn't require government ID
- Doesn't perform KYC (Know Your Customer) checks
- Doesn't verify your identity
- Doesn't ask for proof of residence
- Allows pseudonymous usage (any email works)

<Card title="Why No Identity Verification?" icon="circle-question">
  Storehouses is a portfolio management tool, not a financial institution. You're tracking assets you already own. We believe requiring identity verification would be invasive and unnecessary for the service we provide.
</Card>
