## Overview

Collections allow you to group related items together for better organization and viewing. Think of collections as folders or categories you create to organize your portfolio however makes sense for you.

<Note>
  **Free plan users** have one default collection ("My Collection") to organize their items. **Pro and Lifetime plan users** can create unlimited custom collections. [Upgrade to Pro →](/account/subscription-plans)
</Note>

## What Are Collections?

Collections are user-defined groups of items. Unlike categories (which are fixed based on asset type), collections are completely customizable.

### Remove Items from Collection

To remove an item from a collection:

</Note>

### Delete Collection

## Filtering Within Collections

Use filters to narrow down items within a collection:

- **Search** - Find items by name or description
- **Category** - Show only specific asset types
- **Location** - Filter by storage location
- **Value range** - Show items within a value range
- **Date added** - Filter by when items were added to collection

## Sorting Collections

Sort items within a collection by:
- Name (A-Z or Z-A)
- Value (high to low or low to high)
- Date added (newest or oldest)
- Purchase price
- Category

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Collections Focused" icon="bullseye">
    Create collections with clear criteria rather than mixing unrelated items.

    **Good**: "Gold Sovereigns" (specific coin type)
    **Less Good**: "Valuable Stuff" (too broad)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Descriptive Names" icon="tag">
    Choose names that clearly indicate the collection's contents or purpose.

    **Examples**:
    - "Investment Grade Gold Bullion"
    - "Pre-1933 US Gold Coins"
    - "Grand Cru Bordeaux 2009-2010"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Limit Collection Count" icon="list">
    Too many collections can become hard to manage. Consider:
    - 5-10 collections for most users
    - Use sub-collections or detailed names instead of creating dozens of collections
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update Regularly" icon="arrows-rotate">
    As you acquire new items:
    - Assign them to collections immediately
    - Review collections periodically
    - Remove or reorganize as needed
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
