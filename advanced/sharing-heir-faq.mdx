  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use both Share Links and Heir Access?" icon="check-double">
    Yes! These are completely separate systems designed for different purposes:
    - Use **Share Links** for sharing with professionals who need temporary or ongoing access
    - Use **Heir Access** for trusted family members or beneficiaries who need emergency access
    - The same person can be both a share link recipient AND a designated heir
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need Pro for both features?" icon="crown">
    **Share Links**: Only the account holder needs Pro
    - Recipients don't need Storehouses accounts
    - No subscription required for recipients

    **Heir Access**: BOTH users need Pro/Lifetime
    - Account holder must have Pro/Lifetime
    - Designated heir must also have Pro/Lifetime
    - If either user downgrades, access is immediately revoked
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Share Links FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I name my share links?" icon="tag">
    Yes! Each share link requires a name when you create it. This helps you:
    - Identify different links at a glance
    - Remember who you shared each link with
    - Search for specific links quickly
    - See colored avatars with initials from the name

    Example names: "Financial Advisor Access", "Insurance Renewal 2026", "Estate Attorney"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I search for a specific share link?" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Use the search box at the top of the Share Links page to filter by:
    - Link name
    - URL

    Results update in real-time as you type. The search is case-insensitive.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are the QR codes for?" icon="qrcode">
    Each share link automatically generates a QR code that:
    - Makes it easy to share with mobile devices
    - Can be scanned with any smartphone camera
    - Is 120x120 pixels for optimal scanning
    - Is generated locally in your browser for security
    - Never sent to third-party services

    Simply scan the QR code with a phone camera to open the share link immediately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit a share link after creating it?" icon="pencil">
    Yes! Click the dropdown menu (three dots) next to any share link and select "Edit" to modify:
    - Name
    - Edit permissions
    - Expiration date
    - Max views
    - Password (leave blank to keep existing password)

    The URL stays the same - recipients don't need a new link.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I copy a share link?" icon="copy">
    Two ways to copy:

    1. **Click the URL directly**:
       - Click anywhere on the link in the gray code block
       - See "✓ Copied!" confirmation

    2. **Use the dropdown menu**:
       - Click the three dots (⋮)
       - Select "Copy"
       - Link is copied to clipboard
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens when I delete a share link?" icon="trash">
    When you delete a share link:
    - The link immediately becomes invalid
    - Recipients lose access instantly
    - Any open sessions are terminated
    - The action cannot be undone
    - You'll need to create a new link if access is needed again

    You'll see a confirmation modal showing the link name before deletion.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can share link recipients edit my items?" icon="user-pen">
    Only if you grant "Allow Editing" permission:

    **Read-only (default)**:
    - View items and collections
    - Export to PDF
    - Cannot modify anything

    **Editable**:
    - Add new items
    - Edit existing items
    - Delete items
    - Modify collections

    ⚠️ Only grant edit access to people you fully trust.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How secure are the QR codes?" icon="shield-check">
    QR codes for share links are very secure:
    - Generated in your browser using the `qrcode` npm package
    - Never sent to third-party services
    - Stored only in your browser session
    - Regenerated fresh on every page load
    - No tracking or analytics embedded
    - Simply encode the share URL for convenience
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I set a password on a share link?" icon="lock">
    Yes! When creating or editing a share link, you can:
    - Add password protection
    - Passwords are encrypted with bcrypt hashing
    - Recipients must enter the password to view the share
    - Send the password separately from the link
    - Change the password by editing the link
    - Leave password field blank when editing to keep existing password
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between expiration and view limits?" icon="clock">
    **Expiration Date**:
    - Link becomes inactive on a specific date
    - Time-based automatic deactivation
    - Good for temporary consultations

    **View Limits**:
    - Link becomes inactive after X views
    - Count-based automatic deactivation
    - Good for one-time access

    You can use both together for maximum control.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see who viewed my share links?" icon="eye">
    Share Links show:
    - Current view count
    - Maximum views allowed (if set)
    - Creation date
    - Expiration date (if set)

    However, Share Links do NOT track:
    - Who viewed the link (recipient identity)
    - When specific views occurred
    - IP addresses or device information

    This privacy-first design means recipients aren't tracked.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Heir Access FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why do heirs need their own Pro subscription?" icon="question-circle">
    The dual Pro subscription requirement:
    - **Prevents abuse**: Reduces frivolous or malicious access requests
    - **Validates identity**: Confirms heir has a paid, verified account
    - **Ensures commitment**: Both parties are serious about the feature
    - **Sustains service**: Helps maintain the infrastructure for both users
    - **Security measure**: Additional verification layer for emergency access
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the heir need a Storehouses account?" icon="user-plus">
    Yes! Heirs must have their own Storehouses account:
    - Create account at [storehouses.app](https://storehouses.app)
    - Use the same email address you'll designate them with
    - Upgrade to Pro or Lifetime subscription
    - Only then can you add them as a designated heir

    This requirement ensures proper identity verification and access control.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I grant immediate access without the waiting period?" icon="bolt">
    Yes! There are two paths to grant heir access:

    **Path 1: Heir-Initiated (with waiting period)**
    - Heir requests access
    - Waiting period begins (14-90 days)
    - You receive multiple notifications
    - Auto-approves after waiting period if not denied

    **Path 2: Pre-Approval (immediate)**
    - Click "Grant Access Now" next to any heir
    - Heir receives immediate access for 180 days
    - No waiting period
    - Heir gets instant email notification
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens during the waiting period?" icon="hourglass">
    During a heir-initiated access request:

    **Day 0**:
    - You receive immediate notification
    - One-click denial link included

    **Days 7, 14, 21**:
    - Reminder emails with denial links
    - Shows days remaining

    **24 hours before approval**:
    - Final notice email
    - Last chance to deny

    **After waiting period**:
    - Request auto-approves if not denied
    - Heir receives access for 180 days
    - You get notification of approval
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have multiple heirs?" icon="users">
    Yes! With Pro/Lifetime you can designate unlimited heirs:
    - Each heir is independent
    - Each has their own permission level (read-only or edit)
    - Each can initiate separate access requests
    - You can pre-approve each one separately

    Common setup:
    - Primary: Spouse (edit access)
    - Secondary: Adult child (read-only)
    - Tertiary: Estate executor (read-only)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I pass away during the waiting period?" icon="heart-crack">
    This is the intended behavior:
    - The request will auto-approve after the waiting period
    - Even if you cannot respond
    - This ensures eventual access for legitimate heirs
    - The waiting period provides security against unauthorized requests
    - Multiple email notifications give you time to deny if you're able
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I extend the 180-day access period?" icon="calendar-plus">
    Access cannot be automatically extended, but heirs can renew:

    **Option 1: Heir requests renewal**
    - Submit new access request (Path 1)
    - Goes through waiting period again

    **Option 2: You grant new access**
    - Use "Grant Access Now" (Path 2)
    - Immediate access for another 180 days

    This ensures both users still have Pro subscriptions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I downgrade from Pro?" icon="arrow-down">
    If you downgrade to Free:
    - All active heir access is **immediately revoked**
    - Pending requests are **canceled**
    - Heirs receive notification emails
    - Heir designations are **preserved** in your account
    - Access resumes if you re-upgrade to Pro

    This is an automatic security measure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my heir downgrades from Pro?" icon="user-minus">
    If the heir downgrades to Free:
    - Their active access is **immediately revoked**
    - They **cannot submit** new access requests
    - You **cannot grant** them immediate access
    - They must re-upgrade to Pro to regain access
    - You receive notification of the revocation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between read-only and edit permissions?" icon="user-lock">
    **Read-only** (recommended for most heirs):
    - View all items and collections
    - See all metadata and images
    - Export to PDF and CSV
    - Cannot modify anything

    **Can Edit**:
    - Everything from read-only
    - Add new items
    - Edit existing items
    - Delete items
    - Modify collections
    - Update valuations

    ⚠️ Heirs still cannot access account settings, billing, or password.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I deny an heir access request?" icon="hand">
    Two ways to deny:

    **Option 1: Email link**
    - Open any notification email
    - Click "Deny Access" button
    - Confirm on the website

    **Option 2: Dashboard**
    - Go to [storehouses.app/heir-access](https://storehouses.app/heir-access)
    - Find heir with "Pending" status
    - Click "Deny Request"
    - Confirm denial

    Denial is instant and cannot be undone. Heir must submit new request.

    Yes! Revoke access anytime:

    1. Go to Heir Access page
    2. Find heir with "Access Granted" badge
    3. Click "Revoke Access"
    4. Confirm revocation

    **What happens**:
    - Access immediately revoked
    - Heir loses portfolio access instantly
    - Heir receives notification email
    - Heir remains in your designated heirs list
    - They can request access again later
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What emails do heirs receive?" icon="envelope">
    Heirs receive emails for:

    1. **Request Confirmation**: When they submit access request (Path 1)
    2. **Access Granted**: When access auto-approves after waiting period
    3. **Pre-Approved Access**: When you grant immediate access (Path 2)
    4. **Access Denied**: When you deny their request
    5. **Access Revoked**: When you revoke their active access

    All emails come from `heirs@storehouses.app`
  </Accordion>

    - Access billing information
    - Change your email or password
    - Delete your account
    - Modify heir access settings
    - Create new heirs
    - See your subscription details

    Heirs only access portfolio data (items, collections, locations).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's logged in heir_access_sessions?" icon="list-check">
    The system logs:
    - When heirs access your portfolio
    - Which heir accessed it
    - Timestamps of access sessions

    This provides:
    - Security audit trail
    - Documentation for estate purposes
    - Monitoring of emergency access usage

    Only you can view these logs (heirs cannot).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
