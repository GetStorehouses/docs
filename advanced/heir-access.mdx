## Overview

Heir Access is an emergency access feature that allows you to designate trusted contacts who can request access to your portfolio in case of incapacitation or death. This ensures your valuable asset records aren't lost and your beneficiaries can access important information when needed.

<Note>
  Heir Access is a Pro feature designed for estate planning and emergency preparedness. [Learn more about Pro →](https://storehouses.app/pricing)

## What is Heir Access?

Heir Access provides a secure, time-delayed mechanism for designated individuals to request access to your portfolio. This feature balances security with emergency access needs, ensuring your asset records can be recovered by trusted parties if you become unable to access your account.

## How Heir Access Works

### The Emergency Access Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="You Designate Heirs">
    Set up one or more trusted contacts with their email addresses
  </Step>

  <Step title="Heir Requests Access">
    If needed, your designated heir initiates an access request through Storehouses

  <Step title="You Can Deny Request">
