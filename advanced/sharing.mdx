description: "Create secure share links to provide read-only access to your portfolio"

## Overview

Portfolio Sharing allows you to create secure, read-only links to share your portfolio with trusted individuals such as financial advisors, family members, insurance agents, or accountants. Share your entire portfolio or specific collections with customizable access settings.

## What is Portfolio Sharing?

Portfolio sharing generates unique, secure URLs that grant read-only access to your portfolio data without requiring the recipient to create a Storehouses account. You maintain complete control over what's shared and can revoke access at any time.
