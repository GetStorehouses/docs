## Overview

Alerts is a Pro feature that helps you monitor your collection's value and precious metals market prices by sending automated email notifications when specific conditions are met. Stay informed about market movements and item valuations without constantly checking your dashboard.

<Note>
  Alerts are available exclusively to Pro and Lifetime subscribers. [Upgrade

## Two Types of Alerts

Storehouses offers two types of automated monitoring:

### Price Alerts

Monitor spot prices for precious metals in real-time:

- Gold, Silver, Platinum, Palladium, and Rhodium
- Get notified when metal prices rise above or fall below your specified threshold
- Perfect for tracking market opportunities and timing purchases or sales

### Value Alerts

Monitor individual item valuations in your collection:

- Track specific items based on their total value (market value × quantity)
- Get notified when an item's value crosses your threshold
- Ideal for monitoring investment pieces, high-value items, or insurance thresholds

## How Alerts Work

Understanding how alerts monitor and notify you helps you set effective thresholds and avoid unnecessary emails.

### Automated Monitoring

- **Check Frequency**: Alerts automatically check conditions every 30 minutes
- **Always Running**: Monitoring happens on the server—no need to keep the app open
- **Smart Notifications**: Only sends emails when alert state changes (prevents spam)

### State-Change Detection

Storehouses uses intelligent state-change detection to prevent alert fatigue while keeping you informed of meaningful changes.

**How it works:**

Each alert maintains one of three states:

- **Normal**: Threshold not met
- **Above**: Value exceeded your "above" threshold
- **Below**: Value fell below your "below" threshold

Emails are only sent when the state **changes**, not every time the alert checks.

**Example Timeline** (Gold alert set for "Above $2,000/oz"):

| Time    | Gold Price | State  | Email Sent? | Why?                           |
| ------- | ---------- | ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1:00 PM | $1,980     | Normal | No          | Below threshold                |
| 1:30 PM | $2,010     | Above  | **Yes**     | State changed: Normal to Above |
| 2:00 PM | $2,050     | Above  | No          | State unchanged (still Above)  |
| 2:30 PM | $2,080     | Above  | No          | State unchanged (still Above)  |
| 3:00 PM | $1,990     | Normal | **Yes**     | State changed: Above to Normal |
| 3:30 PM | $2,020     | Above  | **Yes**     | State changed: Normal to Above |

**Result**: You receive 3 targeted emails that notify you exactly when the threshold is crossed—no spam, no missed transitions.

<Tip>
  Without state-change detection, you would receive emails every 30 minutes
  while the price stays above threshold. This smart logic ensures you only get
  notified when something meaningful happens.
</Tip>

## Creating a Price Alert

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Alerts Page">
    Click "Alerts" in the navigation menu
  </Step>

<Step title="Click 'Add Item'">Click the "+ Add Item" button</Step>

<Step title="Select Alert Type">
  Choose "Price Alert" from the type dropdown
</Step>

<Step title="Select Metal Type">
  Choose the precious metal to monitor: - Gold - Silver - Platinum - Palladium -
  Rhodium
</Step>

<Step title="Set Condition and Threshold">
  - **Condition**: Choose "Above" or "Below" - **Threshold**: Enter the price
  per ounce that will trigger the alert
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Alert">
  Toggle the enable switch to activate monitoring
</Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Save" to activate your alert
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Alert Condition Types

### Price Above Target

Receive notification when the spot price rises above your specified amount.

**Example**: Alert me when gold exceeds $2,100/oz

```
Metal: Gold
Condition: Price above
Target: $2,100.00
```

<Tip>
  Use this for sell signals or to track upward momentum in your holdings.
</Tip>

### Price Below Target

Receive notification when the spot price drops below your specified amount.

**Example**: Alert me when silver falls below $24/oz

```
Metal: Silver
Condition: Price below
Target: $24.00
```

<Tip>Use this to identify buying opportunities at your target price.</Tip>

### Percentage Change

Monitor daily percentage changes (increases or decreases) beyond your threshold.

**Example**: Alert me when platinum changes by more than 3% in a day

```
Metal: Platinum
Condition: % change exceeds
Target: 3%
```

<Tip>Use this to stay informed about significant market volatility.</Tip>

## Creating a Value Alert

Monitor individual items in your collection and get notified when their total value crosses your threshold.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Alerts Page">
    Click "Alerts" in the navigation menu
  </Step>

<Step title="Click 'Add Item'">Click the "+ Add Item" button</Step>

<Step title="Select Alert Type">
  Choose "Value Alert" from the type dropdown
</Step>

<Step title="Select Item">
  Choose which item from your collection to monitor
</Step>

<Step title="Set Condition and Threshold">
  - **Condition**: Choose "Above" or "Below" - **Threshold**: Enter the total
  value that will trigger the alert
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Alert">
  Toggle the enable switch to activate monitoring
</Step>

  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Save" to activate your alert
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example**: Create an alert for a rare coin collection with "Above $50,000" to be notified when the total value (market value × quantity) exceeds $50,000.

<Tip>
  Value alerts automatically use the current market value from your item
  details. When you update an item's market value, the alert will use the new
  value in the next check (within 30 minutes).
</Tip>

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How often do alerts check?" icon="clock">
    Alerts check conditions every 30 minutes automatically, 24/7. This provides timely notifications without overwhelming the system or your inbox.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="Will I get an email every 30 minutes if the price stays above my threshold?"
  icon="envelope"
>
  No. Thanks to state-change detection, you only receive an email when the alert
  state changes (crosses the threshold). If the price stays above your
  threshold, you won't receive repeated emails. You'll only be notified when it
  crosses back below, then above again.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I set multiple alerts for the same metal or item?" icon="layer-group">
    Yes, you can create multiple alerts for the same metal or item with different thresholds. For example, one alert for "Gold > $2,000" and another for "Gold > $2,500" to track different price levels.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I disable an alert?" icon="toggle-off">
  Disabled alerts stop monitoring immediately and won't check conditions or send
  emails. You can re-enable them at any time without losing your threshold
  settings. The "Last Triggered" timestamp is preserved.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do alerts work for all metals?" icon="coins">
  Yes, price alerts work for all supported precious metals: Gold, Silver,
  Platinum, Palladium, and Rhodium. Prices are updated regularly from market
  data sources.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I get alerts for multiple items?" icon="boxes">
  Yes, create separate value alerts for each item you want to monitor. Each
  alert operates independently and has its own threshold and state tracking.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if my item's market value changes?" icon="chart-line-up">
  Value alerts automatically use the current market value from your item
  details. When you update an item's market value in your portfolio, the alert
  will use the new value in the next check cycle (within 30 minutes).
</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="Do I need to keep the app open for alerts to work?"
  icon="power-off"
>
  No, alerts run automatically on the server. You can close the app, log out, or
  be offline—alerts will still monitor conditions every 30 minutes and send
  emails when thresholds are crossed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I test my alerts?" icon="flask">
  Yes, temporarily set a threshold you know will trigger immediately (e.g., set
  a gold alert for "Above $1" when gold is at $2,000). You'll receive an email
  within 30 minutes when the alert checks. Remember to adjust the threshold to
  your actual target afterward.
</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="Will alerts notify me when values return to normal?"
  icon="arrows-rotate"
>
  Yes, if you have an "Above" alert and the price drops back below the
  threshold, you'll receive an email notifying you of the state change back to
  normal. This works both ways—you're notified on every state transition.
</Accordion>

<Accordion
  title="How long does it take to receive an email after a threshold is crossed?"
  icon="stopwatch"
>
  Alerts check every 30 minutes, so you'll receive an email within 30 minutes of
  the threshold being crossed. Actual email delivery is typically instant once
  the alert detects the state change.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change the email address for alerts?" icon="at">
    Alerts are sent to your account email address. Update your account email in Account Settings to change where alerts are delivered. The change takes effect immediately for future alerts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Alert Not Triggering" icon="circle-xmark">
    If your alert doesn't trigger when expected:
    - Verify the alert is enabled (toggle is on)
    - Check that the threshold is realistic for current market conditions
    - Confirm your Pro subscription is active
    - Review the "Last Triggered" field to see if it fired recently
    - Wait at least 30 minutes for the next check cycle
    - Verify the current value would actually cross your threshold
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Many or Too Few Emails" icon="bells">
    Understanding email frequency:
    - You receive ONE email per state change (not per check)
    - If prices oscillate around your threshold, you'll get multiple emails (one per crossing)
    - Consider adjusting your threshold away from current prices to avoid oscillation
    - Check "Last Triggered" to review alert activity patterns
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Email Not Received" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Check these common issues:
    - Verify the alert is enabled (toggle is on)
    - Check your spam/junk folder
    - Ensure your account email is correct in Account Settings
    - Wait up to 30 minutes (alerts check every 30 minutes)
    - Verify the threshold would be crossed by current values
    - Check "Last Triggered" to see if the alert fired before
    - Add alerts@storehouses.app to your contacts
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Outdated Prices" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    If displayed prices seem outdated:
    - Refresh your browser to see latest data
    - Check during market hours for most accurate prices
    - Weekend prices may reflect Friday close
    - Alerts continue checking 24/7 regardless of market hours
  </Accordion>
