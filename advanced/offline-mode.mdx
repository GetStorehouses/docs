description: "Use Storehouses as a Progressive Web App with offline functionality"
---

## Overview

Storehouses is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), enabling you to access your portfolio even without an internet connection. Install the app on your devices for a native app-like experience with offline capabilities, faster loading, and home screen access.

## What is Offline Mode?

Offline mode allows Storehouses to function when you don't have internet connectivity. The app caches essential data locally on your device, so you can view your portfolio, browse items, and access information even when you're offline.

## How Offline Mode Works

### Service Worker Technology

Storehouses uses a service worker (Serwist) to enable offline functionality:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Visit">
    When you first visit Storehouses, the service worker installs in your browser
  </Step>

  <Step title="Data Caching">
    App assets and your portfolio data are cached locally on your device
  </Step>

  <Step title="Offline Access">
    When offline, the app serves cached data instead of requesting from servers
  </Step>

  <Step title="Background Sync">
    When connection returns, changes sync automatically to the cloud
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Gets Cached

The app caches:

- **App shell**: UI components, navigation, layouts
- **Static assets**: Images, icons, fonts, stylesheets
- **Portfolio data**: Items, collections, locations
- **Item images**: Thumbnails and full-resolution images
- **Spot prices**: Last fetched precious metals prices
- **User preferences**: Settings and configurations

2. **Refresh**: Latest data is fetched from servers
3. **Update**: Cached data is updated with current information
4. **Notification**: Visual indicator shows sync is complete

<Note>
  Storehouses uses a "server-first" approach. Data edited online by you or other devices takes precedence over cached data.
</Note>

### Manual Refresh

1. Pull down on the dashboard (mobile)
2. Click the refresh button (desktop)
3. Navigate away and back to a page

<Tip>
  Refresh your data before going offline to ensure you have the latest portfolio information.
