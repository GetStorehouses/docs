## Historical Value Tracking

### How Values are Tracked

Wealth Garden shows value evolution through:

**Precious metals**: Automatic daily updates based on spot prices

**Other assets**: Value snapshots at each manual update

**Purchases**: Item additions increase total value

**Sales**: Item removals decrease total value

### Value Update Events

Each point on the chart represents:
- **Item added**: New purchase increases portfolio value
- **Manual update**: You updated an item's market value
- **Automatic update**: Precious metals spot price changed
- **Item sold/removed**: Portfolio value decreased

### Accuracy Considerations

<Warning>
Wealth Garden is only as accurate as your data. Regular value updates for non-precious-metal items ensure realistic portfolio tracking.
</Warning>

**For best results**:
- Update market values quarterly or annually
- Record purchase prices accurately
- Add items promptly after acquisition
- Remove sold items and record sale dates

## Performance Insights

**Sort by**:

## Interpreting Your Wealth Garden

### Growth Patterns

    **Meaning**: Consistent acquisitions and/or value appreciation
    **Action**: Stay the course; your strategy is working
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stair-Step Growth">
    **Pattern**: Flat periods followed by jumps
    **Meaning**: Periodic large purchases with quiet periods between
    **Action**: Normal for many collectors; consider if you want more consistent activity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Volatile Swings">
    **Pattern**: Frequent ups and downs
    **Meaning**: Heavy precious metals allocation (daily spot price changes)
    **Action**: Expected for commodity-based portfolios
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plateau">
    **Pattern**: Flat horizontal line
    **Meaning**: No new purchases and stable values
    **Action**: Consider if this is intentional or if portfolio review is needed

### Allocation Insights

**Concentrated portfolio** (one category dominates):

- **Cons**: Higher risk if that market declines
- **Consider**: Diversifying into complementary assets

- **Pros**: Risk spread across asset types
- **Cons**: May dilute exceptional performance
- **Consider**: Optimal for most collectors

**Emerging diversification** (allocation bands widening):
- **Meaning**: You're actively diversifying
- **Action**: Monitor to ensure intentional strategy

  <Accordion title="Regular Value Updates">
    Update non-precious-metal item values at least annually. This keeps your Wealth Garden chart accurate and useful for decision-making.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Record Purchase Dates Accurately">
    Correct purchase dates ensure timeline accuracy. Even approximate dates are better than none.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add Items Promptly">
    Enter new acquisitions soon after purchase so your growth chart reflects real-time portfolio development.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Milestones">
    Add custom milestones for major events like inheritances, gifts, or significant market events affecting your portfolio.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review Quarterly">
    Make it a habit to review your Wealth Garden quarterly. Look for trends and adjust your collecting strategy accordingly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Compare to Benchmarks">
    Track how your portfolio performs versus relevant benchmarks (gold price, stock market, art indices) over the same time periods.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Document Insights">
    When you notice significant patterns or insights, add notes to milestones or item descriptions for future reference.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy & Security

<Card title="Your Data is Private" icon="lock">
  Wealth Garden visualizations use only your own portfolio data. Nothing is shared with Storehouses or other users unless you explicitly create a share link.
</Card>

**Data handling**:
- All calculations happen in real-time
- Historical data pulled from your item records
- No third-party analytics tracking
- Charts are not cached or stored separately

## Limitations & Considerations

### Data Requirements

Wealth Garden requires:
- At least one item with a purchase date
- Some value data (purchase price or market value)
- Ideally, multiple items over time for meaningful trends

**Limited data scenarios**:
- **New portfolios**: Limited history means short timelines
- **Single category**: No allocation insights
- **No dates**: Items without purchase dates can't be placed on timeline
- **No values**: Items without any valuation data don't contribute

### Value Accuracy

<Warning>
Wealth Garden shows the values you've entered, but doesn't verify their accuracy. For meaningful insights, maintain current and realistic valuations.
</Warning>

**Challenges**:
- **Stale values**: Outdated manual values skew recent performance
- **Missing spot prices**: Precious metals data depends on market APIs
- **Estimated purchases**: Approximate purchase prices reduce cost basis accuracy

## Future Enhancement Ideas

Potential future features for Wealth Garden:

- Comparison to market indices (gold price, S&P 500, art market)
- Scenario modeling (what if I sell X, buy Y?)
- Goal tracking (visualize progress toward target portfolio value)
- Category-specific deep dives
- Correlation analysis between different assets
- Tax reporting integration
